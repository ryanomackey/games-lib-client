# Intro

This is the client-side React/Redux code for my capstone project while at [Galvanize](http://www.galvanize.com). (The back-end can be found [here](https://github.com/ryanomackey/games-lib-server)).

# Features

* Add games to your library, and track their completion.
* Sort through games with a number of filters.
* Watch streams from titles in your library, live from Twitch.
* Add titles to your wishlist, to view pricing data from Amazon.

# Installation

> npm install

There are two scripts:

> npm start

Simply transpiles and serves the site on 8000 (3001 for browserSync).

> npm run dev

Enables live reload, in addition to the above.
